# FureverData

Exploring pet adoption trends through data visualization, inspired by my journey with my adopted petsâ€”Luna, my service dog, and Tiffany, my emotional support cat. This project analyzes factors influencing adoption rates and aims to promote the positive impact of pet adoption.


## Overview

**FureverData** is a solo project that focuses on predicting the likelihood of pets being adopted based on several factors like age, weight, health condition, vaccination status, and more. By analyzing a dataset of animals available for adoption, the aim is to provide insights into which factors most influence adoption decisions and help shelters and agencies increase adoption rates.

In addition to exploratory visualizations, a basic machine learning model is implemented to predict adoption likelihood and identify the most influential factors.

## Findings and Visualizations

### 1. Adoption Likelihood by Pet Type

 **Insight** : Dogs have the highest likelihood of adoption among the different pet types, while rabbits are less likely to be adopted. This trend suggests that dogs' popularity as pets may make them more desirable for adopters.

 **Insight** : Vaccinated pets are significantly more likely to be adopted, with 79% of the likelihood attributed to vaccinated animals. This indicates that vaccination can be a critical factor in an adopter's decision-making process.

### 3. Weight vs. Adoption Likelihood

 **Insight** : The scatter plot suggests that there is a slight variation in adoption likelihood based on a pet's weight, with no extreme weight ranges correlating with a higher adoption probability. However, this relationship may vary with pet type.

### 4. Age Distribution by Pet Type

 **Insight** : The age distribution box plot shows that pets like birds have a wider age range, while rabbits tend to be younger. Understanding age demographics helps shelters highlight younger or older pets depending on adopters' preferences.

### 5. Time in Shelter vs. Adoption Likelihood

 **Insight** : Pets with a longer stay in shelters tend to have a lower likelihood of adoption. The histogram emphasizes the importance of finding new ways to market pets that have been in shelters for extended periods.

### 6. Heatmap of Age vs. Weight and Adoption Likelihood

 **Insight** : The heatmap reveals clusters of age and weight combinations that have higher adoption likelihoods. This can help in tailoring adoption drives for specific age and weight groups that are more likely to find homes.

## Optimizing Adoption Likelihood

A basic machine learning model predicts the likelihood of adoption. It achieves **70% accuracy** and identifies the most important features affecting adoption:

* Age (31.22%)
* Weight (25.44%)
* Vaccination status (9.81%)
* Health condition (7.79%)
* Adoption fee (24.26%)
* Previous owner (1.48%)

The model can be further refined to improve accuracy.

## Ethical Considerations

Efforts were made to ensure ethical use of data, including:

* **Data Privacy** : The dataset is synthetic, with no personal data included.
* **Fair Use** : The dataset adheres to the CC BY 4.0 license, allowing use with proper attribution.
* **Bias** : Care was taken to avoid bias in the dataset, particularly in the factors influencing adoption likelihood.
